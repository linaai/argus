# Argus - A Visa Application Website
- Please note that this is a team project. And only the parts I have been involved are included in this repository

**Brief introduction:** The project was designed for developing a service website to help Australian graduate students plan their permanent residency visa application process. Through resource integration and analysis of Australian immigration policies, the
scoring system rules and algorithms were identified to help international students reasonably arrange for permanent
residence in a more efficient and accurate way. The project was developed in agile methodology and delivered after three
iterations.
